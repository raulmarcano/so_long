 ## Project Rules and Gameplay
Objective: Collect all diamonds and reach the exit while avoiding green pig enemies.
#### Gameplay:
- The game is in 2D perspective (top-down or side view).
- Use W, A, S, D or arrow keys to move the king.
- The player cannot move through walls.
- The number of moves is displayed in the terminal.
- The game ends when all diamonds are collected and the exit is reached.
#### Map:
- Maps are composed of walls, diamonds, open spaces, exit, and the player's starting position.
- The map must be surrounded by walls, and it must have at least one exit, one diamond, and one starting position.
- Maps use the following characters: 0 (Empty space), 1 (Wall), C (Collectible diamond), E (Exit), P (Player's start position).
#### Window Management:
- Pressing ESC or clicking the red cross closes the window and ends the game.
### Error Handling
The game will terminate and display "Error\n" for the following cases:
- The map file is invalid or not found.
- The map is not rectangular.
- The map is not surrounded by walls.
- Duplicate start or exit positions are found.
- No valid path from the start to the exit exists.
#### Floodfill
The game uses the floodfill algorithm to guarantee that the map can be solved.
